    "You will perform a clustering on the songs, using KMeans. The authors identify the optimum number of clusters by using the elbow method (gives four clusters) and the silhouette score (gives two) clusters and taking their average, i.e., three clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use both methods, like the authors, check the results, and then use three clusters. Visualize the clusters by using PCA on two dimensions.\n",

    "Note that the data given by the authors contain the results of their clustering. Of course this will not be a feature that you will use for your clustering. The features you will use for clustering will be:\n",

    "Once you finish your clustering, compare the clusters that you have found with the clusters that the authors have found; how similar are your clusters to theirs? The authors assign activities, given by `activityType`, to clusters as in Table 2. Interpret your clusters like the authors do in the text of the paper and in figures 5, 6, as best as you can. "

The authors build their classifier using Random Forests and they use a series of models, described in Table 3. Do the same, for all models, using scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Report your results.\n",

You may seek help on the Internet, on ChatGPT/Gemini/etc., by Googling or searching in StackOverflow for general questions pertaining to the use of Python and pandas libraries and idioms. However, it is not right to ask direct questions that relate to the assignment and where people will actually solve your problem by answering them. You may discuss with your colleagues in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
